# django_cscards
Small website for creating, managing, and reviewing flashcards, using Django REST Framework for backend and ReactJS for frontend. Originally inspired by https://github.com/jwasham/computer-science-flash-cards

Currently setup integrates the React app into the Django project by inserting the React files directly into the Django project's directory, so that both the React frontend and the Django API can deploy reasonably easily sharing a single Heroku virtual machine.
